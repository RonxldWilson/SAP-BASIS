Note:     
TCODES are assigned for each modules
TCODES - Transaction Codes

IN SAP all operation are carried uisng TCODES, these are codes that can call reports, programs from the user screen

/n denotes a new session. A user can open a max of 6 session, using which they can work in parallel
/o followed by a TCODE causes the current session to close and the given transaction to open in a new session

Each new session means a new window on screen 

What is ERP?

Enterprise Resource Planning: is a business management system that integrates all facets of the 
business including planning, manufacturing, sales distribution and marketing.

##Benefits with ERP​
​
Competition. It’s true that ERP software requires a major investment, but there’s also 
an even bigger cost in not making the investment. While some manufacturers choose to stick 
to the tried and true methods of the past, others seek technology solutions.  Manufacturers 
cannot afford to put off an ERP implementation while their competition invests in ERP and 
starts reaping the many benefits we’ll touch on below.​
​
Efficiency. An ERP solution eliminates repetitive processes and greatly reduces the need 
to manually enter information. The system will also streamline business processes and make 
it easier and more efficient for companies to collect data, no matter what department they’re working in.​
​
Forecasting. Enterprise resource planning software gives your users, and especially managers, 
the tools they need to create more accurate forecasts. Since the information within ERP is as 
accurate as possible, businesses can make realistic estimates and more effective forecasts.​
​
Collaboration. Nobody wants to run a siloed business with each department functioning separate 
from the other. Collaboration between departments is a crucial and often necessary part of the 
business. With the data entered into ERP systems being centralized and consistent, there’s no 
reason why departments can’t work together. The software also touches on almost every aspect 
of a business, thus naturally encouraging collaborative, interdepartmental efforts.​
​
Scalability. Did you know? Structured ERP systems allow the addition of new users and functions 
to grow the initially implemented solution over time. When your business is ready to grow or needs 
more resources, enterprise resource planning software should be able to facilitate that growth.​

Integrated Information. No more issues with data spread across separate databases; 
all information will be housed in a single location. This means you can integrate platforms 
like your CRM software with the ERP system, keeping data consistent, accurate, and unique. 
Know your customer, their orders, and your inventory, all in one place.

Cost Savings. With one source of accurate, real-time information, ERP software reduces administrative and 
operations costs. It allows manufacturers to proactively manage operations, prevents disruptions 
and delays, breaks up information logjams and helps users make decisions more quickly. 
If you’ve chosen the right solution for your business, and the right vendor who meets your needs, 
you’re bound to see a powerful ROI.

Streamlined Processes. As manufacturers grow, their operations become more and more complex. 
Manufacturing software automates business operations cross-departmentally, providing accurate, 
real-time information to everyone utilizing the solution. ERP increases efficiency and productivity 
by helping users navigate complex processes, preventing data re-entry, and improving functions such as 
production, order completion and delivery. Streamlined, efficient processes throughout.

Mobility. An advantage of ERP solutions like WorkWise ERP software is having access to a centralized 
database from anywhere you work. Home, office, wherever, through our mobile-friendly solution and application.

Reporting. ERP software helps make reporting easier and more customizable. With improved reporting capabilities, 
your company can respond to complex data requests more easily. Users can also run their own reports without
relying on help from IT, saving your users time to use toward other projects.

Productivity. Save time and increase productivity levels. Sound too good to be true? It’s not with ERP software. 
By having redundant processes automated, users have more time to work on other pressing projects and tasks. 
They’ll also be able to work easier since the solution was designed for ease-of-use.

Regulatory Compliance. A benefit of ERP software which sometimes goes unnoticed is how it ties well into regulatory 
compliance in the manufacturing industry. Powerful ERP solutions will keep track of regulations within the industry 
and monitor changes in compliance.

Flexibility. Modern ERP software systems are robust, flexible, and configurable. They are not a one-size-fits-all 
proposition but can be tailored to the unique needs of a business. ERP systems also can adapt to the ever-changing 
needs of a growing business, ensuring you won’t have to buy a new solution once your needs change or your business grows.

Customer Service. It’s easier to provide high-quality customer service using an enterprise solution, especially when you’re 
using one as well-equipped as WorkWise ERP. Sales and customer service people can interact with customers better and improve 
relationships with them through faster, more accurate access to customers’ information and history. You’ll also have access 
to marketing automation and contact center software, ensuring your customers are being interacted with consistently.

Security. Data security isn’t a worry when you have an enterprise resource planning solution in place. A new system will 
improve the accuracy, consistency, and security of data, all through built-in resources and firewalls. Restrictions to data 
can also be enhanced by managers of the solution, so you can make your own software as secure as you’d like.

There are various ways to access an SAP System. The most commonly used are 
    SAPGUI for Windows, 
    SAPGUI for JAVA and 
    WEBGUI for browsers​

    SAPGUI is a client utility that has to be installed on a user’s machine​
    
    SAPGUI is available for installation on Windows and on Non-Windows platforms as well​
    
    A JAVA based SAPGUI is required for OS such as Linux or any other Unix flavor​
    
    SAPGUI is available as SAPGUI for HTML, popularly called WEBGUI, that is supported on most 
    common browsers such as IE 6, Firefox 3​
    
    For Windows desktops, the entries in the SAPGUI logon pad are stored in a file called 
    saplogon.ini file, which is located in the path C:\Windows​

########################################
There are few componts which are installed by default which ensures that the SAP runs properly

SAP Architecture - has 3 layers
1. Presentation Layer
2. Application Layer 
3. Database Layer

Layers of SAP

SAP(on Top of Database)
Database (On Top of OS )
Operating System (Contains resources like CPU, RAM and NETWORK)


SAP MMC - SAP Management Console

## OLD Architecture
        |SAP|
    |DATABASE|
|Operating System|

This has issues as the system can go down

## NEW Architecture
    |DATABASE|  <-------------------|SAP|                   |SAP GUI|
|Operating System|              |Operating System|      |Operating System|

#3 tier Architecture
This distributes the load and ensures that the overall system works well​

##############################

SAP R/3 System

R stands for Real Time
3 stands for the layers - 3 tier architecture

# SAP R2 Architectue in which the Database, SAP are together and SAP GUI is separate
# SAP R1 Architectue in which the Database, SAP and SAP GUI are all together 


Presentaion layer on the local system | Application layer and Database layer somewhere else that is R2

########################################################
# Application Layer
Application Layer contains the core services of SAP which keeps the services alive

    Message Server - It handles the communication between the distributed dispatches in ABAP system

    Dispatcher - takes the request from  the Presentaion layer and allocates the requst to work processes
        It is the heart of the SAP System, always ensure that 
        Works on FIFO principle
        POC between the GUI and and the Workprocesses

    Workprocesses - there are 5 types of Workprocesses
        1. Dialog (D)- This does the active work which is assigned | handles all the OLTP Transaction (Online Transational Processing)
        If u are connecting to SAP system thru GUI that means you are connected thru Dialog Workprocess

        2. Background (B) - Can be used to run Background jobs, this is done for running big tasks, like resetting password for 50 people,
            the order directly comes from Dispatcher and takes Enqueue work process with it, lock the table,

              The Jobs which do not require an active intervention is called as background workprocess. 
                It runs automaticallly at the same time.

              In Each systyem there should be atleast 2 background job one
        
        3. Update (V)- This updates the record in the table, the Dialog Workprocesses handles the update Workprocesses
            For updating the System

            Update 2: Responsible for less time critical update

        4. Enqueue (E) - Basically one user can work on one table at a time, it will lock it for other users   
                It works at the OS Level
                It ensures that the work is serialized in the system using the Lock Table 
                It follows FIFO process
                To0 serialize the update and perform lock management

                Locking and unlocking of an object

        5. Spool(S) -  Spool is dedicated Workprocesses for printing 
                For Generating the Reports            

        Two Major Services considers in Workprocesses
        1. Message Services (M) - Gives oxygen to the Dispatcher
                It's a kind of service which allows you to talk to other SAP System, like QA, Prod and all
        
                It is reponsible for communication between diffrent dispacther of diffrent SAP system or within the same system.

        2. Gateway Services (G)- It's a kind of service which allows you to talk to other 3rd party system.
        It can also allows the communication beteween two SAP system
        
        It allows if the commuication can be passed or not, the message server established the commuincation, 

        Message Server - Create the connection / Establish the connection
        Gateway Server - It creates the approval for the connection, if it is allowed to happen or not
        
        3. ICM (Internet Communication Manager) - There is only 1ICM per SAP system. The ICM recieves request for 
        HTTP protocol and forwards it to the ABAP dispatcher for further processing 

SAP uses the acronym DVEBMGSxx, where xx is the instance number to denote an SAP instance within the SAP system.

    Example : If an SAP system comprises of 1 Central instance with number 01, and 2 Dialog Instances, 
    with number 02 and 03, then the SAP system is said to be comprised of 
    DVEBMGS01, DVEBMGS02 and DVEBMGS03 instances

Dispathcers needs the Message Server, the Work Process needs Dispatcher to work, the Message Server needs the Database work


AS ABAP stands for Application Server ABAP

Installation of SAP
SAP is segregated in 2 parts:

ASCS - ABAP SAP Central Service and 
PAS - Primary Application Service

Instance Number - Needs to be between 00-99 - Should be numeric

# Give ASCS as 01 instance number
# and PAS as 00 instance number

ASCS is a core component of SAP server which contains the Message Server and Enqueue Server
PAS contains Dispatcherm, Gateways and ICMs

High availability Pair Basically like what happens in ServiceNow
OR 
Disaster Recovery

There is one in the Metro location and other in Geo Location

if there is USR> SAP folder 
OR in Task Manager-> Services -SAPDB201
SAP services are running in the SERVICES in TASK Manager then that means the system has SAP installed

### Never let the message server go down



## Presentaion layer gives the output
# Once you are in presentation layer then you get access to application layer
# Once you are in authenticated you move on to the application
# Then the application layer access the database layer

## There Tier Architectue

1. Presentation Layer - Those SAP R/3 software components that specialize in interacting with end users forms the presentation layer
2. Application Layer - Those components that specialize in processing business applicaitons form the application layer
3. Database Layer - Those components that specialize in the management, storage and retrieval of data form the Database Layer.

Presentaion Layer is aka Client Layer

Application Server
    Application Server includes specialized systems multiple CPUs annd with large amount of RAM 
    SAP apps are executed in applicaiton layer
    It serves as a communicator between the presentation and database layer 
    Application server is where the Dispatcher distributes the workload to the diffrent work processes that makes the job done

Database Servers 
    Database server contains specialized systems with fast and large drives
    Database server stores and retreives data as per SQL queries generated by ABAP and JAVA applicaiton
    Data store can be Business data, SAP system data, SAP tables, Programs.
    Database and Application may exist on the same or different physical location
    Examples − Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB/2, Siebel, Sybase, etc.

Client in SAP
    A client is a logical portion of an SAP R/3 physical database. 

Points to Remember −
    All customizing (configuration) and development (ABAP) work in SAP R/3 is performed in a client.
    However, the data from both customizing and development work may be stored within an individual client (client dependent data) or among all clients (client independent data) in the system.

Client Independent Data - Data contained across all clients in SAP system.
    Ex: Datra dictionary objects(Tables, Views), ABAP Source Code, Screens and Menus 
Client Dependent Data - Data specific to an individual client
    Ex: Number Ranges, ABAP Variants, and user masters as well as the that is created or updated thru SAP R/3 transaction

TCODE SM11 - Data dictionary
    If the table has the first entry as MANDT (Then the table is client Dependent)
    otherewise the table is client independent
    
SAP instance:
    Dialog Instance:  Dialog instance exists in the application layer. Its purpose is to maintain the 
    load on the server. Dialog instance exists on the different host. If a number of dialog instance
    increases hardware resources, dispatcher, work processes also increases so that more number of
    users can login at a time.

    Central Instance: Central instance can also work as dialog instance. But the main thing is 
    that it contains Enqueue and message servers. All dialog instances communicate with central 
    instance before requesting  database with message server. When an instance is started, the 
    dispatcher process attempts to establish a connection to the message server so that it can 
    announce the services it provides (DIA, BTC, SPO, UPD, etc.).Lock table is managed in 
    central instance by enqueue service.

What is SID?
    SID is a unique identification code for every R/3 installation (SAP system) consisting of 
    a database server & several application servers. SID stands for SAP System Identification. 
    SAPSID — a three-character code such as C11, PRD, E56, etc.)

Logical System Names :
    A logical system is an application system in which the applications work together on a common database. I
    In SAP terms, the logical system is a client.
    Since the logical system name is used to identify a system uniquely within the network, 
    two systems cannot have the same name if they are connected to each other as source systems, 
    or if there are plans to connect them in any way.

SID – PBG
Logical System Name – PBGCLNT100

TCODE SM50 - Displays all the Work Processes

It is also possible to view ABAP work process as Unix Processes
    On a UNIX OS level these processes are denoted by "dw"
    ICM is denoted as icman
    Gateway is deonted as gwrd
    Message Server is denoted as ms

Client Architectue

SAP Reference Clients
These clients provide diffrent features and must not be deleted
Clinet 000 - Performs special functions, In particulare it is given ectended functionalities during upgrades
Clinet 001 - is Basically a copy of client 000 and can be used as a basis for new customizing clients
Client 066 - is a special client which is provided for operational system Monitoring, It is used by SAP R/3 Early watchers to provide performance recommendations

What is Client?
A client is a logical partition in the workspace

Client Administration:
SAP is an applicaiton which allows to create 1000 partiion within it, starting from (000-999), we can use any 
except the 000 , and 066


##  In Prod It is required to work in a single Client.
## In dev it is recoommended to work with one client, but if there is a R&D requirement, you can create a new
client which imports the objects from the OG client

## Client Roles
Customizing - For Configuring Client setting and create new functionality
Test - For testing functionality and verifying configuration
Production - For productive activites and business data
Demo - For experimenting with Customizing Transaction and setting (A Sandbox client to transaction)
Training - For end user training
SAP References - SAP refernce client setting

You may have access to client 100, but not Client 130

# if you are making changes in Standard - then it will change for all clients
# cross client objects aka workbench request, if a change is made on standard change, then standard change made in clinet 100 ads well as client 200
# Non Cross Client object aka Customizing object, in this the changes of one are not affecting the chagnes of other.


Client Administration tools:
TCODE - SCCC3 - Client Monitoring
TCODE - SE06 - Set restriction for individual components
TCODE - SCC4 - Maintain Clients / client management/ Client Administration / Create new client

TCODE - SCCL - Local Client Copy 
TCODE - SCC9 - Remote Client Copy 
SCC5 - Client Delete
TCODE - Client Import Export

TCODE - SCC1 - Special function SCC1
    TCODE - SCC5 - Delete Client // Used during system refresh, to delete the clients in 
    TCODE - SCU0 - Table Analysis

Client Transport    
    TCODE - SCC8 - Client Export
    TCODE - SCC7 - Client Post process import
        For proccessing the imported transport
    TCODE - SCC9 - Remote client copy Without using TMS / Transport Management System

TCODE - SCC3 Client Copy logs

When you create a new client, you will need to copy the Golden Data from the Client 000, 

## System refresh is done only to Quality instances, it is the copying of the data from Prod to QA 
## Every 6 months we do a system refresh to ensure that the data is same in both the instances
# 


## Before the System Refresh, we take a backup of the client configurations using Client Transport / Client Export
## If this is not done, it  might have the setting of prod, which

## Client Independent tables should not be copied in clinet copy to diffrenet System
## Select Client Profile -  SAP_ALL, SAP_CUST, SAP_APPL, etc 


Logical Client Name and  Virtual Client Name - BD54

## For System refresh we use SAP_USER Client Copy profile

## Client is like a partioin in the workspace, and the place where you will work


R4E is a SAP Server which has 2 departments
1. 100 -Finance 
2. 200 - HR

Split Client for the system for non prod system, divide the workspace and everyone works on diffrenet Client 
Use one client in the Production


SAP Netweaver 
and S4 HANA

Associate level Certification


Export and Import are done during the Remtore Client Copy, Export is done on the Source side and the import on the target system

Bundeled package is called as Transport

RDDIMDP --> Import Transports into target system, this BackgroundJob runs and imports the Transports
        
Transport Management System - This is a one time task which is done
Domain Controller - This maintains the paths - Created thru development System
 
For every Transport Request 
Data File = Dentoed by R - This contains the Real data which I want to move
Co File =  Denoted by K - Something Like Metadata, what does the data contain. It contains the information about the data. 

and the path at OS Level usr/sap/trans/ 

Once the Developer Clicks on Release, then the data and Co-file are creaeted

Ways of Importing:
1. Manual Import: 
2. Automatic Import:

Background Jobs

In Dialsog Max allowed time is 600 seconds = 10 Mins

# what is a background Job/background workprocess?
If a process is going to exceed 600 secs, then we go for background jobs

if a job needs to run on Dec31st of every year, then we use a job scheduler to schedule a background job

Job Class A>B>C (Priority of the Job)

TCODE SM36 - Scheduling a background job
Execution Target - The Server thru which the job should Run

You can create steps for the background job
- Step user

Start Condition - when should it run
    -Immediate
    -Date/Time
    -After Job 
    -After Event Job


SM37 - Simple job Selection / Search 

Status of a job:
- Scheduled
- Released
After Release no changes are possible

- Ready 
- Delay 
- Active

- Finished
- Cancelled

No Background process should run for more than 24hrs

-if there is Z in the name then it's for that particular client




SM36 - To Schedule a new Job \
SM37  -To monitor a job

To schedule a job we need, variant name, user, program

Operation Mode - Day Mode and Night Mode


1. Go to SM36
2. Define the Job

Day 9

What is Kernel?
Its acts as a communicator between the OS and DB

Operating System
Linux/Unix - Redhat/SUSE 
Windows - Microsoft 
AIX - IBM
AS400 - IBM

DataBase
Oracle -> Oracle
MS SQL -> Microsoft
DB2 -> IBM
HANA -> SAP
SYBASE -> SAP

BASIS is also called as Infrastructure solution

Since there are too many combinations possible between the OS and DB, to make the process simple SAP wants
us to install a Kernel along with it.

Kernel acts like a Middleware which makes the two compatible

## Kernel Upgrade Activity

Go to https://support.sap.com 

And Download

Kernel -> DB Independent -> Linux 
Kernel -> DB Dependent -> Linux -> oracle

Extract and update the file system -- /sapmnt/exe 

SAP Note - When there are issues found in the standard program provided by the SAP, then SAP would create 
    SAP Note which has correction instruction for that certain program. 

    Then the BASIS admin will implement the SAP Note in the SAP solution.

TCODE - SNOTE - Download the note/implement the note given

Support Package and Enhancement

SAP every quaterly basis will release a Support Pack which will have
    -   Set of SAP Notes
    -   New feeatures which are added
    -   New Security Fix added

    It's name could look like: SAP BASIS Release 740 SP 02

    - IT's ONLY FOR ONE COMPONET

Stack Upgrade SPSS upgrade
    -   Basically a set of support packs 
    -   IT CAN BE COMBINATION OF VARIOUS COMPONETS

Version Upgrade
    -   Set of Stack Upgrade

    It's name could look like: SAP BASIS Release 750 SP 02

TCODE - SPAM if we have to install a new support pack then we have to use SPAM
TCODE - SAINT - Installing a component then we have to use SAINT

To deploy anything new we use SAINT
To patch anything we use SPAM


Suppose u have 
    SAP BASIS SP01 ->SAP BASIS SPO2 -> U will beed to use SPAM
    Install SAP BASIS-> SAINT -> SAP BASIS SP01 to SPO2 -> Using SPAM

DATABASE Concepts

Database Management System (DBMS) - includes database processes, a buffer in the main memory, data files that 
contain the data, and log files, where changes to the data are logged. 

Buffer - A memory for faster access

The data is stored in the data files: Access to the data always takes place using the buffer in main memory.

Diffrence beteween Structure Data and Data Files?
Structure Data can be a table
Data files could be images or audio files

OLTP - Online Transaction Processing
OLAP - Online Analytic Processing

In traditional DB they used two kinds of DB to do the transaction and another for processing

In SAP HANA, both have been elimninated and all is handled in one DB 

ACID compliant ???


SAP HANA is an in-memory data platform that is deployable as an on premise appliance, or in the cloud.  
It is a revolutionary platform that’s best suited for performing real-time analytics, and developing and 
deploying real-time applications. 

SAP HANA is different by design.
    It stores all data
    1. In-memory
    2. Columnar format
    3. Compressed

Generally in HANA DB the Disk Space and RAM is same. Therefore it is called In-memory data platform

TCODE - 

Row Store Vs Column Store

HANA DB stores the Data in Column DB

## SAP HANA Architectue
Daemon - It is responsible for all other process and keep them running

Index Server - which is responsible to save and do operations on the DB. It contains teh actual data and the engine for processing the data

Name Server -  the name server owns the information about the topology of the SAP HANA system

XS Engine - Allows Developeer to write and Run SAP based HANA appls without the need for additional Server
    Also used to run web-based tools that come with SAP HANA, for instance for administration, lifecycle management and development.

Extended Store Server - It is part of the SAP HANA dynamic tiering option of SAP HANA. It provides a high-performance disk-based column 
    store for very big data up to the petabyte range.

HDI Server - HDI handles the deployment of design-time artifacts into SAP HANA.

Data Provisioning Server - It provides capabilities such as data provisioning in real time and batch mode, real-time data transformations, 
    data quality functions, adapters for various types of remote sources, and an adapter SDK for developing additional adapters.

Streaming Cluster - Smart data streaming extends SAP HANA with capabilities of SAP Event Stream Processor for consuming data streams and complex event processing. 

Compile Server - Does the compilation of the stored procedure. It runs on every host

Preprocedure Sever - Feeds unstructured data (for example text , documents) into SAP HANA

SAP Web Dispatcher - Entry point for HTTPs Requests

SAP Start srv / Service  -  Responsible for starting and stopping the otehr service

Database Backups: DB should be backed up to avoid loss due to disk failure
    we can backup these files: Data Area, Log Area, Config Files (.ini)

HANA Backup capabilities:
    Full backup
    Delta Backup
    Redo Log Backups
    Backup and Recovery using third party tools
        Backend Tool can be used for backup
    Integrity Checks for Backups
    Backup lifecycle Management

    Recovery to the most recent state - uses log backup recovery
    Recovery to a specific point in time 
    Recovery to a specific data backup - No log files are considered 
    
    Database copy using backup and Recovery

Performing Backups:
    Backups can be created using the following tools:
    Creating data backups manually:
        -  SAP HANA cockpit
        -  SAP HANA studio
        -  DBA Cockpit
        -  SQL commands (command line)



Backup Types: 
1. Full Data Backup - 
2. Incremental Backup - The data changed since the last full data bacup or the last delta backup
3. Diffrential Backup - The data changed since the last full data backup 

Backup Destination - 


SAP start stop Command
    startsap <instance>
    stopsap <instance>

SAP control is a kernel executable file which follows a number
    sapcontrol -nr 10 -function StopSystem  //instance no 10 has been stopped
    sapcontrol -nr 01 -function StopSystem  //instance no 01 has been stopped
    sapcontrol -nr 02 -function StopSystem  //instance no 02 has been stopped

    sapcontrol -nr 00 -function GetProcessList

For HANA DB the start/stop commands are:
    sapcontrol -nr 02 -function StopSystem  //instance no 02 has been stopped

Need to become sidadm 
    and then use: HDB stop // for HANA stop just do use this
                HDB start // for HANA start

df -kh = shows how many mounts you have / the number of drives you have

Schema User - SAPABAP1 User is also created for SAP HANA 

User Level restrictions to ensure that the database is not entirely used up by one database

System Replication: basically the high availability PAIR like in ServiceNow

Now when the downtime is planned, we need to unregister the secondary systme 
to ensure that the secondary doesn't become primary

Unregister and then Disable the system then enable system replication

Replication is available only for PROD systems
