##Benefits with ERP​
​
Competition. It’s true that ERP software requires a major investment, but there’s also 
an even bigger cost in not making the investment. While some manufacturers choose to stick 
to the tried and true methods of the past, others seek technology solutions.  Manufacturers 
cannot afford to put off an ERP implementation while their competition invests in ERP and 
starts reaping the many benefits we’ll touch on below.​
​
Efficiency. An ERP solution eliminates repetitive processes and greatly reduces the need 
to manually enter information. The system will also streamline business processes and make 
it easier and more efficient for companies to collect data, no matter what department they’re working in.​
​
Forecasting. Enterprise resource planning software gives your users, and especially managers, 
the tools they need to create more accurate forecasts. Since the information within ERP is as 
accurate as possible, businesses can make realistic estimates and more effective forecasts.​
​
Collaboration. Nobody wants to run a siloed business with each department functioning separate 
from the other. Collaboration between departments is a crucial and often necessary part of the 
business. With the data entered into ERP systems being centralized and consistent, there’s no 
reason why departments can’t work together. The software also touches on almost every aspect 
of a business, thus naturally encouraging collaborative, interdepartmental efforts.​
​
Scalability. Did you know? Structured ERP systems allow the addition of new users and functions 
to grow the initially implemented solution over time. When your business is ready to grow or needs 
more resources, enterprise resource planning software should be able to facilitate that growth.​
