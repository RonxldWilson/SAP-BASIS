##Benefits with ERP​
​
Competition. It’s true that ERP software requires a major investment, but there’s also 
an even bigger cost in not making the investment. While some manufacturers choose to stick 
to the tried and true methods of the past, others seek technology solutions.  Manufacturers 
cannot afford to put off an ERP implementation while their competition invests in ERP and 
starts reaping the many benefits we’ll touch on below.​
​
Efficiency. An ERP solution eliminates repetitive processes and greatly reduces the need 
to manually enter information. The system will also streamline business processes and make 
it easier and more efficient for companies to collect data, no matter what department they’re working in.​
​
Forecasting. Enterprise resource planning software gives your users, and especially managers, 
the tools they need to create more accurate forecasts. Since the information within ERP is as 
accurate as possible, businesses can make realistic estimates and more effective forecasts.​
​
Collaboration. Nobody wants to run a siloed business with each department functioning separate 
from the other. Collaboration between departments is a crucial and often necessary part of the 
business. With the data entered into ERP systems being centralized and consistent, there’s no 
reason why departments can’t work together. The software also touches on almost every aspect 
of a business, thus naturally encouraging collaborative, interdepartmental efforts.​
​
Scalability. Did you know? Structured ERP systems allow the addition of new users and functions 
to grow the initially implemented solution over time. When your business is ready to grow or needs 
more resources, enterprise resource planning software should be able to facilitate that growth.​

There are various ways to access an SAP System. The most commonly used are SAPGUI for Windows, 
SAPGUI for JAVA and WEBGUI for browsers​

SAPGUI is a client utility that has to be installed on a user’s machine​
SAPGUI is available for installation on Windows and on Non-Windows platforms as well​
A JAVA based SAPGUI is required for OS such as Linux or any other Unix flavor​
SAPGUI is available as SAPGUI for HTML, popularly called WEBGUI, that is supported on most 
common browsers such as IE 6, Firefox 3​
For Windows desktops, the entries in the SAPGUI logon pad are stored in a file called saplogon.ini file, 
which is located in the path C:\Windows​


########################################
There are few componts which are installed by default whihc ensures that the SAP runs properly

SNOTE: SAP NOTE - This is given by SAP as an instruction, Basically a Knowledge Article, which are used to fix issues

There are 2 types of SAP Notes:
1. Manual Correction
2. By using SNOTE TCDOE we can implement solution

SAP Architecture - has 3 layers
1. Presentation Layer
2. Application Layer 
3. Database Layer

Layers of SAP

SAP(on Top of Database)
Database (On Top of OS )
Operating System (Contains resources like CPU, RAM and NETWORK)


SAP MMC - SAP Management Console

## OLD Architecture
        |SAP|
    |DATABASE|
|Operating System|

This has issues as the system can go down

## NEW Architecture
    |DATABASE|  <-------------------|SAP|                   |SAP GUI|
|Operating System|              |Operating System|      |Operating System|

#3 tier Architecture
This distributes the load and ensures that the overall system works well​

##############################

SAP R/3 System

R stands for Real Time
3 stands for the layers 

# SAP R2 Architectue in which the Database, SAP are together and SAP GUI is separate
# SAP R1 Architectue in which the Database, SAP and SAP GUI are all together 


Presentaion layer on the local system | Application layer and Database layer somewhere else that is R2

# Application Layer
Application Layer contains the core services of SAP which keeps the services alive

    Message Server - 
    Dispatcher - takes the request from  the Presentaion layer and allocates the requst to work processes
        It is the heart of the SAP System, always ensure that 
        Works on FIFO principle
        POC between the GUI and and the Workprocesses

    Workprocesses - there are 5 types of Workprocesses
        1. Dialog (D)- This does the active work which is assigned | handles all the OLTP Transaction (Online Transational Processing)
        If u are connecting to SAP system thru GUI that means you are connected thru Dialog Workprocess

        2. Background (B) - Can be used to run Background jobs, this is done for running big tasks, like resetting password for 50 people,
            the order directly comes from Dispatcher and takes Enqueue work process with it, lock the table,

              The Jobs which do not require an active intervention is called as background workprocess. 
                It runs automaticallly at the same time.

              In Each systyem there should be atleast 2 background job one
        
        3. Update (V)- This updates the record in the table, the Dialog Workprocesses handles the update Workprocesses
            For updating the System

        4. Enqueue (E) - Basically one user can work on one table at a time, it will lock it for other users   
                It works at the OS Level
                It ensures that the work is serialized in the system using the Lock Table 
                It follows FIFO process
                To0 serialize the update and perform lock management

                Locking and unlocking of an object

        5. Spool(S) -  Spool is dedicated Workprocesses for printing 
                For Generating the Reports            

        Two Major Services considers in Workprocesses
        1. Message Services (M) - Gives oxygen to the Dispatcher
                It's a kind of service which allows you to talk to other SAP System, like QA, Prod and all
        
                It is reponsible for communication between diffrent dispacther of diffrent SAP system or within the same system.

        2. Gateway Services (G)- It's a kind of service which allows you to talk to other 3rd party system.
        It can also allows the communication beteween two SAP system
        
        It allows if the commuication can be passed or not, the message server established the commuincation, 

        Message Server - Create the connection / Establish the connection
        Gateway Server - It creates the approval for the connection, if it is allowed to happen or not
        
Dispathcers needs the Message Server, the Work Process needs Dispatcher to work, the Message Server needs the Database work

RFC - Remote fuction call

TCODE - SU01 (Helps in Create, delete, and change values)
TCODE - SM50 (To see the work processes) (To see if the system is healthy) (All the process should be in waiting status)
TCODE - SM04 (Shows the people logged in the system) (or USER Session) (can be used to check if a user is using too much RAM)

SAP system are of two types
ABAP SAP System -   It's found in GUI       
JAVA SAP System -   There will be no GUI here, you will have to login online
                    You have to work on URLs in a browser
                    There is no Workprocesses here           
                    There are no TCODEs here

Installation of SAP
SAP is segregated in 2 parts:

ASCS - ABAP SAP Central Service and 
PAS - Primary Application Service

Instance Number - Needs to be between 00-99 - Should be numeric

# Give ASCS as 01 instance number
# and PAS as 00 instance number

ASCS is a core component of SAP server which contains the Message Server and Enqueue Server
PAS contains Dispatcherm, Gateways and ICMs

High availability Pair Basically like what happens in ServiceNow
OR 
Disaster Recovery

There is one in the Metro location and other in Geo Location

if there is USR> SAP folder 
OR in Task Manager-> Services -SAPDB201
SAP services are running in the SERVICES in TASK Manager then that means the system has SAP installed

### Never let the message server go down



## Presentaion layer gives the output
# Once you are in presentation layer then you get access to application layer
# Once you are in authenticated you move on to the application
# Then the application layer access the database layer

SAP - Global User Interface
SAP applicatioon is were you will be using the functionalities provided by the SAP

# DB could be anything S4/HANA, Microsft SQL, Oracle

# Database is the main storage unit of the SAP

#######################################################################
Client Architectue

SAP Reference Client
Clinet 000
Clinet 066
Client 001

What is Client?


Client Administration:
SAP is an applicaiton which allows to create 1000 partiion within it, starting from (000-999), we can use any 
except the 000 , and 066


##  In Prod It is required to work in a single Client.
## In dev it is recoommended to work with one client, but if there is a R&D requirement, you can create a new
client which imports the objects from the OG client

## Client Roles
Customizing - For Configuring Client setting and create new functionality
Test - For testing functionality and verifying configuration
Production - For productive activites and business data
Demo - For experimenting with Customizing Transaction and setting (A Sandbox client to transaction)
Training - For end user training
SAP References - SAP refernce client setting

You may have access to client 100, but not Client 130

# if you are making changes in Standard - then it will change for all clients
# cross client objects aka workbench request, if a change is made on standard change, then standard change made in clinet 100 ads well as client 200
# Non Cross Client object aka Customizing object, in this the changes of one are not affecting the chagnes of other.


Client Administration tools:
TCODE - SCCC3 - Client Monitoring
TCODE - SE06 -Set restriction for individual components
TCODE - SCC4 - Maintain Client s / client management/ Client Administration / Create new client

TCODE - SCCL - Local Client Copy 
TCODE - SCC9 - Remote Client Copy 
TCODE - Client Import Export
TCODE - SCC1 - Special function SCC1
    TCODE - SCC5 - Delete Client // Used during system refresh, to delete the clients in 
    TCODE - SCU0 - Table Analysis

Client Transport    
    TCODE - SCC8 - Client Export
    TCODE - SCC7 - Client Post process import
    TCODE - SCC9 - Remote copy Without using TMS / Transport Management System
TCODE - SCC3 Client Copy logs


When you create a new client, you will need to copy the Golden Data from the Client 000, 

## System refresh is done only to Quality instances, it is the copying of the data from Prod to QA 
## Every 6 months we do a system refresh to ensure that the data is same in both the instances
# 


## Before the System Refresh, we take a backup of the client configurations using Client Transport / Client Export
## If this is not done, it  might have the setting of prod, which

## Client Independent tables should not be copied in clinet copy to diffrenet System
## Select Client Profile -  SAP_ALL, SAP_CUST, SAP_APPL, etc 


Logical Client Name and  Virtual Client Name - BD54

## For System refresh we use SAP_USER Client Copy profile

## Client is like a partioin in the workspace, and the place where you will work


R4E is a SAP Server which has 2 departments
1. 100 -Finance 
2. 200 - HR

Split Client for the system for non prod system, divide the workspace and everyone works on diffrenet Client 
Use one client in the Production


SAP Netweaver 
and S4 HANA

Associate level Certification


Export and Import are done during the Remtore Client Copy, Export is done on the Source side and the import on the target system

DAY 5

Transport Management System

Bundeled package is called as Transport
        
Transport Management System - This is a one time task which is done
Domain Controller - This maintains the paths - Created thru development System
 
For every Transport Request 
Data File = Dentoed by R - This contains the Real data which I want to move
Co File =  Denoted by K - Something Like Metadata, what does the data contain. It contains the information about the data. 

and the path at OS Level usr/sap/trans/ 

Once the Developer Clicks on Release, then the data and Co-file are creaeted

Ways of Importing:
1. Manual Import: 
2. Automatic Import:  

This process is owned by SAP BASIS


Changes to PROD requires all the approvals are achieved - You can't do auto import here.
From Quality to Prod we move it manually. 


Transport Management Can be configured only in 000 Client

#Three Types of Tranaport Requests
workbench Request - For all the clietns
Customizing - For a specific client
Transport of Copies

TCODE STMS_IMPORT - To import a Transport

Transport Request are created in DEV ins


Consolidated Route
Delivery Route

The Route between Dev-->QA-->PreProd is consolisdated route 

The Route between PreProd --> Prod is Delivery route 

SE01 -Create a Transport - Workbech Request

Give the Transport to Developer
Release the Transport
Import the Transport in QAS using STMS_IMPORT

Day 6

Background Jobs

In Dialsog Max allowed time is 600 seconds = 10 Mins

# what is a background Job/background workprocess?
If a process is going to exceed 600 secs, then we go for background jobs

if a job needs to run on Dec31st of every year, then we use a job scheduler to schedule a background job

Job Class A>B>C (Priority of the Job)

TCODE SM36 - Scheduling a background job
Execution Target - The Server thru which the job should Run

You can create steps for the background job
- Step user

Start Condition - when should it run
    -Immediate
    -Date/Time
    -After Job 
    -After Event Job


SM37 - Simple job Selection / Search 

Status of a job:
- Scheduled
- Released
After Release no changes are possible

- Ready 
- Delay 
- Active

- Finished
- Cancelled

No Background process should run for more than 24hrs

-if there is Z in the name then it's for that particular client




SM36 - To Schedule a new Job \
SM37  -To monitor a job

To schedule a job we need, variant name, user, program

Operation Mode - Day Mode and Night Mode


1. Go to SM36
2. Define the Job
3.
