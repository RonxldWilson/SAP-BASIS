##Benefits with ERP​
​
Competition. It’s true that ERP software requires a major investment, but there’s also 
an even bigger cost in not making the investment. While some manufacturers choose to stick 
to the tried and true methods of the past, others seek technology solutions.  Manufacturers 
cannot afford to put off an ERP implementation while their competition invests in ERP and 
starts reaping the many benefits we’ll touch on below.​
​
Efficiency. An ERP solution eliminates repetitive processes and greatly reduces the need 
to manually enter information. The system will also streamline business processes and make 
it easier and more efficient for companies to collect data, no matter what department they’re working in.​
​
Forecasting. Enterprise resource planning software gives your users, and especially managers, 
the tools they need to create more accurate forecasts. Since the information within ERP is as 
accurate as possible, businesses can make realistic estimates and more effective forecasts.​
​
Collaboration. Nobody wants to run a siloed business with each department functioning separate 
from the other. Collaboration between departments is a crucial and often necessary part of the 
business. With the data entered into ERP systems being centralized and consistent, there’s no 
reason why departments can’t work together. The software also touches on almost every aspect 
of a business, thus naturally encouraging collaborative, interdepartmental efforts.​
​
Scalability. Did you know? Structured ERP systems allow the addition of new users and functions 
to grow the initially implemented solution over time. When your business is ready to grow or needs 
more resources, enterprise resource planning software should be able to facilitate that growth.​

SAP BASIS - SAP Administration
    - Start/Stop of SAP system
    - Upgradation of SAP System
    - Installation of SAP System
    - Integration of SAP System



# SAP BASIS ADMINISTRATOR

Will need to learn more about the SAP products, the Databases, the Networks and how they work, 
will need to learn multiple OS(Windows, AIX, Linux)

# SAP Landscape

    Sandbox - Play area for the System. Used for R&D
    Dev System - Create Changees or enhancements as per business requirements
    Quality/Testing assurance system- Test of the Development activity
    Production - Business System (Be careful while working on this)

    Training System - 
    Regression/Migration - 
        SAP System Refresh - Basically clone down from PROD

SAP PAM - Product availability Matrix (Very Important to ensure that the product is working properly)
This contains the documentation for SAP products. This also contains a list of dependencies to ensure that the 
correct servers and Database Versions are installed for that particular product.

EHP - Enhancement Patch released for a version
######################################

Reporting and Tracking a support incident
    Report an Incidnet

SLicense - Every SAP system has a License Key, this is required for PROD instances


########################################
There are various ways to access an SAP System. The most commonly used are SAPGUI for Windows, 
SAPGUI for JAVA and WEBGUI for browsers​

SAPGUI is a client utility that has to be installed on a user’s machine​
SAPGUI is available for installation on Windows and on Non-Windows platforms as well​
A JAVA based SAPGUI is required for OS such as Linux or any other Unix flavor​
SAPGUI is available as SAPGUI for HTML, popularly called WEBGUI, that is supported on most 
common browsers such as IE 6, Firefox 3​
For Windows desktops, the entries in the SAPGUI logon pad are stored in a file called saplogon.ini file, 
which is located in the path C:\Windows​


########################################
There are few componts which are installed by default whihc ensures that the SAP runs properly

SNOTE: SAP NOTE - This is given by SAP as an instruction, Basically a Knowledge Article, which are used to fix issues

There are 2 types of SAP Notes:
1. Manual Correction
2. By using SNOTE TCDOE we can implement solution

GoTo> Upload SAP Note
GoToDownlaoad SAP Note>Enter Note Numeber> Execute

Can be implemented?
It can implemetned to fix the issues

.SAR file - IT's like a ZIP File
unCARing the SAR file gets the Media File

SAPCAR - using this Software

Command to UNCAR the SAR File 
CMD > SAPCAR -xvf SAPCARDJASDHNJKLASDN.SAR

SAPinst> Run as Admin

# DAY 2
SAP Architecture - has 3 layers
1. Presentation Layer
2. Application Layer 
3. Database Layer

Layers of SAP

SAP(on Top of Database)
Database (On Top of OS )
Operating System (Contains resources like CPU, RAM and NETWORK)


SAP MMC - SAP Management Console

## OLD Architecture
        |SAP|
    |DATABASE|
|Operating System|

This has issues as the system can go down

## NEW Architecture
    |DATABASE|  <-------------------|SAP|                   |SAP GUI|
|Operating System|              |Operating System|      |Operating System|

#3 tier Architecture
This distributes the load and ensures that the overall system works well​

##############################

SAP R/3 System

R stands for Real Time
3 stands for the layers 

# SAP R2 Architectue in which the Database, SAP are together and SAP GUI is separate
# SAP R1 Architectue in which the Database, SAP and SAP GUI are all together 


Presentaion layer on the local system | Application layer and Database layer somewhere else that is R2

# Application Layer
Application Layer contains the core services of SAP which keeps the services alive

    Message Server - 
    Dispatcher - takes the request from  the Presentaion layer and allocates the requst to work processes
        It is the heart of the SAP System, always ensure that 
        Works on FIFO principle
        POC between the GUI and and the Workprocesses

    Workprocesses - there are 5 types of Workprocesses
        1. Dialog - This does the active work which is assigned | handles all the OLTP Transaction (Online Transational Processing)
        2. Background - Can be used to run Background jobs, this is done for running big tasks, like resetting password for 50 people,
            the order directly comes from Dispatcher and takes Enqueue work process with it, lock the table,  
        3. Update - This updates the record in the table, the Dialog Workprocesses handles the update Workprocesses
        4. Enqueue - Basically one user can work on one table at a time, it will lock it for other users   
                It works at the OS Level

        5. Spool -  Spool is dedicated Workprocesses for printing 
        
        Two Major Services considers in Workprocesses
        1. Message Services - Gives oxygen to the Dispatcher
                It's a kind of service which allows you to talk to other SAP System, like QA, Prod and all
        2. Gateway Services - It's a kind of service which allows you to talk to other 3rd party system.
                
        
Dispathcers neeeds the Message Server, the Work Process needs Dispatcher to work, the Message Server needs the Database work


TCODE - SU01 (Helps in Create, delete, and change values)
TCODE - SM50 (To see the work processes) (To see if the system is healthy) (All the process should be in waiting status)
TCODE - SM04 (Shows the people logged in the system) (or USER Session) (can be used to check if a user is using too much RAM)
TCODE - RZ10 (Used for Editing the user profiles)
TCODE - SM36 (allows for scheduling Background Jobs)
TCODE - SM12 - Lock Entires in SAP system (Shows the tables which have been locked)
TCODE - SPAD Integration with printers??
TCODE - SLicense - Shows all the License keys
TCODE - ST06 to check the utilization

SAP system are of two types
ABAP SAP System -   It's found in GUI       
JAVA SAP System -   There will be no GUI here, you will have to login online
                    You have to work on URLs in a browser
                    There is no Workprocesses here           
                    There are no TCODEs here
                
                Server Nodes:    

These two system talk using Gateway Channel

Installation of SAP
SAP is segregated in 2 parts:

ASCS - ABAP SAP Central Service and 
PAS - Primary Application Service

Instance Number - Needs to be between 00-99 - Should be numeric

# Give ASCS as 01 instance number
# and PAS as 00 instance number

ASCS is a core component of SAP server which contains the Message Server and Enqueue Server
PAS contains Dispatcherm, Gateways and ICMs

High availability Pair Basically like what happens in ServiceNow
OR 
Disaster Recovery

There is one in the Metro location and other in Geo Location

if there is USR> SAP folder 

OR in Task Manager-> Services -SAPDB201

SAP services are running in the SERVICES in TASK Manager then that means the system has SAP installed

Never let the message server go down
