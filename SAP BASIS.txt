# SAP BASIS Overview

SAP Basis refers to the administration of SAP system that includes activities like installation
and configuration, load balancing, and performance of SAP applications running on Java
stack and SAP ABAP. This includes the maintenance of different services related to
database, operating system, application and web servers in SAP system landscape and
stopping and starting the system.

The key responsibilities of SAP Basis Administrator include:
    - System installation and Configuration
    - Load balancing on servers
    - Performance management of different components
    - Managing interfaces and integration with servers
    - Managing servers and different services

With the help of SAP Basis, different SAP modules like Finance Accounting, Production
Planning, Sales and Distribution, SAP EWM and other modules can integrate and
communicate with each other.

SAP Basis supports the installation and configuration of SAP applications on different
operating systems like Windows, Unix, AS/400, etc. and different databases like SQL
Server, Oracle, IBM DB2 for back end database.

#SAP Instance and SID

A SAP instance is when you install and configure a SAP system. This instance defines a
group of resources — memory, processors and other resources in the system. This allows
users to login to the SAP system and share the same resources.

SAP instance is managed by CCMS. Users can login to the SAP system using an instance.

A SAP system can consist of one or more instances — you can set up a SAP system with
a single instance with only one CCMS or you can configure a system with two or more
separate instances in client/server environment


#Configuring a SAP instance

You need to follow these steps to configure a SAP instance:
    Step 1: You need to define separate directories for UNIX, AS/400, or Microsoft Windows
    NT server on which the instance is to run.
    Step 2: You can use a shared file system.
    Step 3: For each instance, there are entries created in operating system configuration
    files (/etc/services, /etc/sapconfig…).
    Step 4: There are communication entries created in the host.
    Step 5: For each instance, start and system profiles are created.
    Step 6: For each instance, operating system users are installed.

Creating an instance for one server
You need to follow these steps to create an instance for one server:
    Step 1: To create an instance, you should first define the mode of operation.
    Step 2: To create an instance, go to CCMS > Configuration or use Transaction code RZ04.
    Step 3: Go to instances/operation modes
    Step 4: To create a new instance, click on create new Instance — (F6) op:
    Step 5: Enter the host name and click on current settings. When application server is
    already running, the system will display the current settings for that instance.
    Step 6: If the application server is not running, you should use the input help to display
    the possible entries and fill the below values.
    Step 7: Enter the host name and choose current settings. If the application server is
    already running, the system will display the current settings for that instance. However, if
    the application server is not yet running, you should use the input help to display the
    possible entries and fill in the following fields:

The SAP System Number is the number that is mentioned when the SAP System is
installed.

#Start Profile: Profile Name
Insert the name of the start profile from Profiles to start the instance. You can also click
on “choose the input help” to display a list of available start profiles. You can select a
profile from the available list.

#Instance Profile: Profile Name
You have to select the name of instance profile from Profiles to run the instance. You can
click on “input help” to display a list of available instance profiles.
To save the instance, click on Save button at the top > Continue

#Maintaining Instance Definition
When you define operation modes, you need to maintain instance definition. Follow these
steps to change the definition:
    Step 1: Use Transaction Code: RZ04
    Step 2: Select Instances/operation mode
    Step 3: Select an entry from the list of productive instances.
    Step 4: You can then change the data for that instance.
    Step 5: You can also delete an instance, operation mode using the same transaction code.
    Step 6: To delete an operation mode — From the list of productive operation modes,
    position the cursor on a line with the operation mode. Select operation mode > Delete.
    This deletes the operation mode, and all the instances and work process definitions
    assigned to it.

#System Landscape
The presentation layer communicates with the application server to perform all the
processing and which is known as brains of an SAP system.

An application server consists of multiple instances and communicates with the database
layer of the three-tier architecture.

The bottom layer is called the database layer. This is responsible to store all the data.
The database of SAP system is kept on a separate server for performance and security
reasons.

The presentation layer consists of different components for ABAP and JAVA that enables
the communication and processing of data in SAP system.

The key components of the presentation layer include the following:
    - Message Server – This is used  to manage communication between distributed
    dispatchers in the ABAP system.
    
    - Message Server – This is used to manage server processes and JAVA dispatchers.
    It is used to manage communication within JRE.

    - Dispatcher Queue – This is used to store multiple work process types.
    
    - Dispatcher – This is used to distribute the requests to the work processes.
    
    - Memory Pipes – This is used to manage communication between ICM and ABAP
    work processes.
    
    - Enqueue Server – This is used to handle logical locks set by the executed Java
    application program.
    
    - Java Dispatcher – This is responsible to receive the client requests via
    presentation layer and forward to the server process.
    
    - Gateway – This is used to manage communication between SAP system and
    external systems.
    
    - ABAP Work processes – This separately executes dialog steps in R/3 applications
    separately.
